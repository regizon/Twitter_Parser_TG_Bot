# Twitter_Parser_TG_Bot
Twitter parser with notifications in telegram

Important! I'm used Chrome version 110.0.5481.77 and uploaded this webdriver here, if you want to use other version - you need to download chromedriver here

https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html

Step 1. Go to https://t.me/BotFather and input /newbot and create your bot;

Step 2. Go to https://t.me/getmyid_bot and save your user ID;

Step 3. Write your token bot from BotFather and your user ID in config.py ( chat_id = your user ID )

Step 4. Start "requirements.bat", this will load all modules for parser. Or open requirements.txt and install modules manually.

Step 5. Start bot and use it!
